Greetings Earthling,

Thank you for checking out data from Exoplanet Watch. You will have two weeks from the date you received your confirmation email to use this data to generate a light curve for AAVSO submission. You will receive an email notification at the end of the two weeks when your data checkout expires.

    3) Use EXOTIC, our data reduction software, to turn the telescope data into a light curve
        - https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/exotic/welcome/

    4) Upload your light curve to AAVSO
        - https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/how-to-contribute/how-to-submit-your-data/
        - Light curves from AAVSO will published on weekly basis here: https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/results/

    5) Share your light curve with the Exoplanet Watch community on Slack
        - Post your light curve on the data-upload channel: uol-ets.slack.com    


Here are a few parameters from your dataset to help you get started with building an inits file for EXOTIC:

RA                  : 305.322897           (20:21.29 Right Ascension)
DEC                 : 59.512568            (+59:30.75 Declination)
OBJECT              : TRES-5 b             (Name of object observed)
FILTER              : Clear                (Photometric Filter)
OBSERVAT            : Whipple Observatory  (Observatory name)
LATITUDE            : 31.68                (Local latitude)
LONGITUD            : 110.88               (Local longitude)
WEATHER             : 87.0                 (Estimated sky conditions: 0-100 = poor to excellent, = -1 if no data)
HEIGHT              : 1268.0               ((Local elevation above sea level, in meters))
